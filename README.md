# Ai_Chatbot
AI Chatbot built with Django, NLP, and speech recognition. Supports text and voice queries, retrieves AI knowledge from a structured knowledge base, and provides contextual responses.
# AI Chatbot - Django Web Application

An **AI-powered Chatbot** built using **Django**, designed to answer questions specifically about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.  
It supports **text input** and **voice input**, retrieves answers from a structured knowledge base, and speaks responses using text-to-speech (TTS).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Django Web Framework
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

## üåü How It Works

- The chatbot reads from a **knowledge base file** (`ai_knowledge.txt`)
- Abbreviations like "AI" are mapped to their full forms for accurate matching
- Queries are **lemmatized** and cleaned for better matching
- Responses are retrieved using **topic and subtopic detection**
- Text-to-speech responses are generated in a **separate thread** to avoid blocking the server

## üåü Acknowledgements

Inspired by advancements in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **conversational agents**.  
Special thanks to the open-source community for libraries like **Django**, **NLTK**, **pyttsx3**, and **SpeechRecognition**.
